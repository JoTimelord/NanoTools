## C++ based looper

In this folder, there is a "standard" C++ looper that is hooked up to NanoCORE already, implementing
some same-sign selections.

### Instructions

Edit `doAll.C` with an appropriate file (or hopefully the default one still exists).

```bash
root -b -q -l -n doAll.C
```

This loops and creates `output.root`, which contains a handful of histograms.
