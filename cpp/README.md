## C++ based looper

In this folder, there is a "standard" C++ looper that is hooked up to NanoCORE already.

### Instructions

Edit `doAll_ss.C` with an appropriate file (or hopefully the default one still exists).

```bash
root -b -q -l -n doAll_ss.C
```

This loops and creates `output.root`, which contains a handful of histograms.
